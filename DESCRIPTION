Description: Tools for writing functions for TypeScript applications using Rserve, with methods for compilation and deployment of applications in the format expected by 'rserve-ts'. The package allows users to easily specify Javascript input types and Rserve output types for Ocap (object capability) functions. The companion library 'rserve-ts', available on npm <https://www.npmjs.com/package/rserve-ts>, provides the necessary infrastructure to run these functions in a Typescript environment.
