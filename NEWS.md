# ts 0.1.0 - Initial release

The initial developmental release of `ts`.

API expected to change in future releases as it is tested in various example
applications, so if you happen to use this in a project I suggest you
pin the version:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ws1/ts@0.1.0")
```
